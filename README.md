# node-api-erpnext-v12
nodejs API wrapper for Erpnext v11 and 12


## Description

This library is meant to be a bridge from the native Frappe API for ERPNext on NodeJS/JS projects. 

## Notes on first commit:


As of today, it uses the "[request-promise](https://github.com/request/request-promise-native)" npm package to handle promises, but is already deprecated, here is a list of [alternatives](https://github.com/request/request/issues/3143): 


I have used it on personal projects, but I want to make it available to others to use it and to push it as a npm package.

This needs a testing framework, eslint, documentation, and some functions that somehow stop working (one for getting list of documents and filters).

Contributors wanted.


Thanks
Enrique
