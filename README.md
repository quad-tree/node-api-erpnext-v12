# node-api-erpnext-v12
nodejs API wrapper for Erpnext v11 and 12


## Description

This library is meant to be a bridge from the native Frappe API for ERPNext on NodeJS/JS projects. 

please refer to [Frappe](https://github.com/frappe/frappe) for further information.
The original idea is to be able to acces ERPNext instances from NodeJS easily.
